# AI Image Texture Replacement Project

This project, completed for an AI skills assessment, demonstrates a method for applying a source material texture onto multiple target surfaces within an indoor image. The process involves 2D perspective transformation and occlusion handling using OpenCV.

## Project Artifacts

- `img-process.ipynb`: The complete Jupyter Notebook containing all code, methodology, and diagnostic steps.
- `indoor.jpeg`: The original input image.
- `material.jpeg`: The source material texture.
- `result_image.jpeg`: The final image generated by the notebook.

## How to Run

This project runs in a standard Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or Google Colab).

### 1. Dependencies

You must have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

### 2. Run the Notebook

Ensure `indoor.jpeg` and `material.jpeg` are in the same directory as the notebook.

Open `img-process.ipynb`.

Run all cells from top to bottom.

The final output image will be displayed inline at the end of the notebook.
